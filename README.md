      2. Once the user setâ€™s up their account they will be able to login and view their account home page which will list all the current tickets they submitted and the status of each one.

    For Tech Support Admin:

      1. They will have a Admin Login to view the dashboard and edit various features of all tickets.

List of Technologies that You Plan to Use:

    1. Vue.js or Angular 1.6 for the Frontend Framework
    2. Rails for the Backend Framework

A Well-Defined and Written-Out Prioritized Feature List:

    1. Main Web Page will be taken from WordPress and revamped using Vue or Angular
    2. Write API's that will handle opening, closing, and assigning tickets

    2. Add mobile environment capability that allows the end user and tech support admin to download the app and have the ability track the status of tickets or submit new ones
    3. Also have the chat feature available in the mobile app
